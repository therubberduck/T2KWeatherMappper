Add daily events (compact)

Add daily events (by shift)

Wrap weather events across midnight (if an event starts at 22:00 and ends at 2:00, we want 
to note that on both days, instead of just writing 22:00-23:00 and 00:00-2:00)

Support +0/-0 temps (freezing rain vs snow around 0C) throughout the generation process

Experiment with wind gusts
